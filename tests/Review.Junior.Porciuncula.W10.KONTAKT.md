The W-10 library contains 14 patches that cover the most iconic sounds of the Korg 01/W, such as the Universe, M1 Piano, Organ 2, and Brass 1. You can switch between the patches without cutting the audio, and you can also combine them using the superknob. The library also features a memory manager that allows you to reduce the memory consumption by loading only the samples you need.
 
The library is compatible with Kontakt 5.6 or higher, and it requires about 4.5 GB of disk space. The sound quality is excellent, and the samples are carefully recorded using the mLan16 output (Digital FireWire). The library also includes a custom interface that gives you access to various parameters, such as volume, pan, reverb, chorus, filter, and envelope.
 
The W-10 library is a great option for anyone who wants to add some vintage synth sounds to their productions. The library captures the essence of the Korg 01/W, and it offers a lot of flexibility and control. You can get the library from Junior Porciuncula's Facebook page for $50.
  
If you want to hear how the W-10 library sounds, you can check out some sound demos on YouTube. There are videos that showcase the performance mode, where you can layer and split up to eight patches, as well as the program mode, where you can tweak each patch individually. You can also find videos that compare the W-10 library with the original Korg 01/W hardware, and see how faithful the emulation is.
 
The W-10 library is not the only product by Junior Porciuncula, a Brazilian musician and sound designer. He has also created other libraries for Kontakt, such as the Yamaha S90 ES, the Compact Stage Pianos, and the Fantasy, which is based on the Roland Fantom. You can find more information about his products on his Facebook page or his website.
 
The W-10 library is a must-have for fans of the Korg 01/W, or for anyone who wants to add some retro synth flair to their music. The library is easy to use, sounds great, and offers a lot of value for its price. You can get it from Junior Porciuncula's Facebook page for $50.
