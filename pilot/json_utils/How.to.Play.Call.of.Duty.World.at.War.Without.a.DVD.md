A No-DVD crack is a file that replaces the original executable of the game and allows you to run it without the DVD. This way, you can enjoy the game without any hassle. However, you should be careful when downloading and using No-DVD cracks, as they might contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and install a No-DVD crack for Call of Duty: World at War v1.7, which is the latest version of the game. We will also provide you with some tips on how to avoid getting infected by malicious files.
 
## Step 1: Download the No-DVD Crack
 
The first step is to download the No-DVD crack for Call of Duty: World at War v1.7. You can find it on various websites that offer game fixes and patches, such as MegaGames[^1^]. Make sure you download the file that matches your game version and language.
 
The file name should be CALL.OF.DUTY.WAW.V1.7.ALL.NODVD.ZIP. It is a ZIP archive that contains two files: codwaw.exe and codwawmp.exe. These are the cracked executables for the single-player and multiplayer modes of the game, respectively.
 
Before you download the file, make sure you scan it with an antivirus program or an online scanner, such as VirusTotal. This will help you detect any potential threats that might be hidden in the file. If the file is clean, proceed to download it. If not, look for another source.
 
## Step 2: Install the No-DVD Crack
 
The second step is to install the No-DVD crack for Call of Duty: World at War v1.7. To do this, you need to extract the ZIP archive and copy the cracked executables to your game folder.
 
First, locate your game folder on your computer. It should be something like C:\Program Files (x86)\Activision\Call of Duty - World at War. If you have installed the game in a different location, go there instead.
 
Next, open the ZIP archive that you downloaded and extract its contents to a temporary folder. You should see two files: codwaw.exe and codwawmp.exe.
 
Then, copy these two files and paste them into your game folder, overwriting the original ones. You might need to provide administrator permission to do this.
 
Finally, launch the game from either codwaw.exe or codwawmp.exe, depending on whether you want to play single-player or multiplayer mode. You should be able to play without inserting the DVD.
 
## Tips and Warnings
 
- Always backup your original game files before applying any No-DVD crack. This way, you can restore them if something goes wrong or if you want to uninstall the crack.
- Always download No-DVD cracks from reputable sources and scan them for viruses before using them. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or pop-ups that might redirect you to malicious websites or downloads.
- Always update your game to the latest version before applying any No-DVD crack. This will ensure compatibility and stability of the game.
- Always disable your antivirus program or firewall temporarily when installing or running any No-DVD crack. Some antivirus programs or firewalls might detect the cracked executables as false positives and block them from running or delete them.
- Always use No-DVD cracks for personal use only and do not distribute them online or offline. Using No-DVD cracks might violate the terms of service or end-user license agreement of the game and result in legal consequences.
