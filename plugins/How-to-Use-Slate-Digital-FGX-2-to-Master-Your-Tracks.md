## Step 1: Load Slate Digital FGX 2 on your master bus
 
The first step is to load Slate Digital FGX 2 on your master bus, after any EQ or other processing you may have. You can use the default settings or choose from one of the presets that suit your genre and style. You can also adjust the input and output levels to match your desired loudness.
 
## Step 2: Adjust the FG-Comp settings
 
The next step is to tweak the FG-Comp settings to control the dynamics of your mix. You can use the threshold knob to set the level at which compression starts to kick in, and the ratio knob to set how much compression is applied. You can also use the attack and release knobs to fine-tune how fast or slow the compressor reacts to changes in level. The make-up gain knob allows you to compensate for any volume loss due to compression.
 
## Step 3: Adjust the FG-Level settings
 
The final step is to adjust the FG-Level settings to optimize the loudness and saturation of your mix. You can use the constant gain monitoring button to toggle between the processed and unprocessed signals without changing the perceived volume. You can also use the dynamic perception knob to enhance or reduce the perceived dynamics of your mix. The low punch and detail knobs allow you to boost or cut the low and high frequencies respectively, while the ITP knob controls how much inter-sample peak limiting is applied. The ceiling knob sets the maximum output level of your mix.
 
## Conclusion
 
Slate Digital FGX 2 is a versatile mastering plugin that can help you achieve professional-sounding results with minimal effort. By using its two modules, FG-Comp and FG-Level, you can compress, saturate and limit your mix in a transparent and intelligent way.
